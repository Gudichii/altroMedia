                The specific purpose and methods of personal data processing depend 
                greatly on the type of business relationship within which the data are collected.

                transparently and pursuant to the legal regulations. 
                The processing is limited to those personal data that are necessary 
                for conducting our business activities and the data are used for the 
                purpose for which they were collected, 
                whether they were obtained from the data subjects, 
                by third parties or from publicly available sources 
                (court register, Croatian Financial Agency - FINA). 
                The data are processed for legitimate interests 
                (for conducting court proceedings and keeping records of them, 
                detecting perpetrators of criminal offenses and preventing fraud, 
                protecting persons and property etc.), for complying with contractual 
                obligations (when the processing is necessary for execution of contracts 
                in which the respondent is a contractual party etc.) 
                and legal obligations, etc.
